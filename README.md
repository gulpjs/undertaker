undertaker
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gulpjs/undertaker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gulpjs/undertaker)

Task registry that allows composition through `series`/`parallel` methods.

## Usage

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var Undertaker = require('undertaker');

var taker = new Undertaker();

taker.task('task1', function(cb){
  // do things

  cb(); // when everything is done
});

taker.task('task2', function(){
  return fs.createReadStream('./myFile.js')
    .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./myFile.copy.js'));
});

taker.task('task3', function(){
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    // do things

    resolve(); // when everything is done
  });
});

taker.task('combined', taker.series('task1', 'task2'));

taker.task('all', taker.parallel('combined', 'task3'));
```

## API

__Task functions can be completed in any of the ways supported by
[`async-done`](https://github.com/phated/async-done#completion-and-error-resolution)__

### `new Undertaker([RegistryConstructor])`

The constructor is used to create a new instance of `Undertaker`. Each instance of
`Undertaker` gets its own instance of a registry. By default, the registry is an
instance of [`undertaker-registry`](https://github.com/gulpjs/undertaker-registry)
but it can be any other registry that follows the [Custom Registries API](#custom-registries).

To use a custom registry, pass the custom registry's constructor function when
instantiating a new `Undertaker` instance. This will use the custom constructor
to create the registry for this instance.

### `task([taskName,] fn)` => [Function]

Both a `getter` and `setter` for tasks.

If a string (`taskName`) is given as the only argument, it behaves as a `getter`
and returns the registered function.

If a function (`fn`) and optionally a string (`taskName`) is given, it behaves as
a `setter` and will register the task by the `taskName`.  If `taskName` is not
specified, the `name` or `displayName` property of the function is used as the `taskName`.

__Note: If you attempt to register the same function with different names, it will
only be registered by the last name attempted.__

Will throw if:

* `taskName` is missing or not a string when behaving as a `getter` or
is missing and function is anonymous when behaving as a `setter`.
* `fn` is missing or not a function when behaving as a `setter`.

### `series(taskName || fn...)` => Function

Takes a variable amount of strings (`taskName`) and/or functions (`fn`) and
returns a function of the composed tasks or functions. Any `taskNames` are
retrieved from the registry using the `get` method.

When the returned function is executed, the tasks or functions will be executed
in series, each waiting for the prior to finish. If an error occurs, execution
will stop.

### `parallel(taskName || fn...)` => Function

Takes a variable amount of strings (`taskName`) and/or functions (`fn`) and
returns a function of the composed tasks or functions. Any `taskNames` are
retrieved from the registry using the `get` method.

When the returned function is executed, the tasks or functions will be executed
in parallel, all being executed at the same time. If an error occurs, all execution
will complete.

### `registry([registryInstance])`

Optionally takes an instantiated registry object. If no arguments are passed, returns
the current registry object. If an instance of a registry (`customRegistry`) is passed
the tasks from the current registry will be transferred to it and the current registry
will be replaced with the new registry.

The ability to assign new registries will allow you to pre-define/share tasks or add
custom functionality to your registries. See [Custom Registries](#custom-registries)
for more information.

### `tree([options])` => Object

Optionally takes an object (`options`) and returns an object representing the
tree of registered tasks. The object returned is [`archy`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/archy)
compatible when assigned to the `nodes` key. Also, each node has a `type`
property that can be used to determine if the node is a `task` or `function`.

#### `options`

* `deep` - if the whole tree should be returned (Default: `false`)

### `lastRun(task, [timeResolution])` => [Timestamp]

Takes a string or function (`task`) and returns a timestamp of the last time the task
was run successfully. The time will be the time the task started.

Returns `undefined` if the task has not been run.

If a task errors, the result of `lastRun` will be undefined because the task
should probably be re-run from scratch to get into a good state again.

The timestamp is always given in millisecond but the time resolution can be
reduced (rounded down). The use case is to be able to compare a build time
to a file time attribute. On node v0.10 or with file system like HFS or FAT,
`fs.stat` time attributes like `mtime` precision is one second.

Assuming `undertakerInst.lastRun('someTask')` returns `1426000001111`,
`undertakerInst.lastRun('someTask', 1000)` returns `1426000001000`.

The default time resolution is `1000` on node v0.10, `0` on node 0.11+ and iojs.
it can be overwritten using `UNDERTAKER_TIME_RESOLUTION` environment variable.

__Note: if you use a custom registry that modifies the function (such as `.bind`),
you will need to use the string for `task` instead of a function because we have no
way of looking up the function that was altered.__

## Custom Registries

Custom registries are constructor functions allowing you to pre-define/share tasks
or add custom functionality to your registries.

A registry's prototype should define:

- `init(taker)`: receives the undertaker instance to set pre-defined tasks using the `task(taskName, fn)` method.
- `get(taskName)`: returns the task with that name
   or `undefined` if no task is registered with that name.
- `set(taskName, fn)`: add task to the registry. If `set` modifies a task, it should return the new task.
- `tasks()`: returns an object listing all tasks in the registry.

You should not call these functions yourself; leave that to Undertaker, so it can
keep its metadata consistent.

The easiest way to create a custom registry is to inherit from
[undertaker-registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/undertaker-registry):

```javascript
var util = require('util');

var DefaultRegistry = require('undertaker-registry');

function MyRegistry(){
  DefaultRegistry.call(this);
}

util.inherits(MyRegistry, DefaultRegistry);

module.exports = MyRegistry;
```

### Sharing tasks

To share common tasks with all your projects, you can expose an `init` method on the registry
prototype and it will receive the Undertaker instance as the only argument. You can then use
`undertaker.task(name, fn)` to register pre-defined tasks.

For example you might want to share a `clean` task:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var util = require('util');

var DefaultRegistry = require('undertaker-registry');
var del = require('del');

function CommonRegistry(opts){
  DefaultRegistry.call(this);

  opts = opts || {};

  this.buildDir = opts.buildDir || './build';
}

util.inherits(CommonRegistry, DefaultRegistry);

CommonRegistry.prototype.init = function(takerInst){
  var buildDir = this.buildDir;
  var exists = fs.existsSync(buildDir);

  if(exists){
    throw new Error('Cannot initialize common tasks. ' + buildDir + ' directory exists.');
  }

  takerInst.task('clean', function(){
    return del([buildDir]);
  });
}

module.exports = CommonRegistry;
```

Then to use it in a project:
```javascript
var Undertaker = require('undertaker');
var CommonRegistry = require('myorg-common-tasks');

var taker = new Undertaker(CommonRegistry({ buildDir: '/dist' }));

taker.task('build', taker.series('clean', function build(cb) {
  // do things
  cb();
}));
```

### Sharing Functionalities

By controlling how tasks are added to the registry, you can decorate them.

For example if you wanted all tasks to share some data,  you can use a custom registry
to bind them to that data. Be sure to return the altered task, as per the description
of registry methods above:

```javascript
var util = require('util');

var Undertaker = require('undertaker');
var DefaultRegistry = require('undertaker-registry');

// Some task defined somewhere else
var BuildRegistry = require('./build.js');
var ServeRegistry = require('./serve.js');

function ConfigRegistry(config){
  DefaultRegistry.call(this);
  this.config = config;
}

util.inherits(ConfigRegistry, DefaultRegistry);

ConfigRegistry.prototype.set = function set(name, fn) {
  // The `DefaultRegistry` uses `this._tasks` for storage.
  var task = this._tasks[name] = fn.bind(this.config);
  return task;
};

var taker = new Undertaker();

taker.registry(new BuildRegistry());
taker.registry(new ServeRegistry());

// `taker.registry` will reset each task in the registry with
// `ConfigRegistry.prototype.set` which will bind them to the config object.
taker.registry(new ConfigRegistry({
  src: './src',
  build: './build',
  bindTo: '0.0.0.0:8888'
}));

taker.task('default', taker.series('clean', 'build', 'serve', function(cb) {
  console.log('Server bind to ' + this.bindTo);
  console.log('Serving' + this.build);
  cb();
}));
```
